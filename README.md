**cog_measure.script** measures spectral centre of gravity over portions of a given textgrid interval. It goes through a given directory and writes the results to a .txt file in the same directory. 

**duration_measure.script** measures durations of textgrid intervals. It goes through a given directory and writes the results to a .txt file in the same directory. 

**formant_measure.script** measures formants at given points based on textgrid intervals. It goes through a given directory and writes the results to a .txt file in the same directory. 

**harmonicity_measure.script** measures harmonicity over a given textgrid interval or intervals. It goes through a given directory and writes the results to a .txt file in the same directory.

**pitch_duration_measure.script** takes several pitch measurements over given textgrid intervals, along with interval durations. It goes through a given directory and writes the results to a .txt file in the same directory. 

**rms_measure.script** measures root-mean-square amplitude over a given textgrid interval or intervals. It goes through a given directory and writes the results to a .txt file in the same directory.
